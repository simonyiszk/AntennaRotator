AntennaRotator
==============

## Features
  
- Yaesu GS-232 compatible interface with nearly full feature-set
- Integrated azimuth error correction for small positive errors
   
## How to use
  
- Unbox your G5500, then calibrate the box according to the manual
- Install your G5500 to the mast. Pay attention for choosing the north direction precisely! The compass of your iPhone is not accurate enough. You may use Google Maps, point your antennas to a well-known point, then triangulate the angle of it, by cropping the image and arctan the image resolution ratio.
- Calibrate the output of the controller box
- Calibrate your panel with the ```max``` variable
- Set your installation error with the calibrate variable. Only positive values work.
- Setup ```rotctld``` with the ```602``` model number.
